        Clicking on the map opens a popup for creating a question for the users close to that location.
        You should fill the question and provide 4 possible answers. You are required to choose the correct answer by selecting the correct radio button on the right
        of each answer.

        <br/><br/>
        Clicking 'Add Question' will submit the question to the server. Users of the quiz app that are close to that location will receive the question on their app. Clicking 'Cancel' will abort.
